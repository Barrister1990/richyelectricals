          question: "What types of generators do you service and sell?",
          answer:
            "We work with all major generator types and brands, including diesel, petrol, and gas generators from manufacturers like Cummins, Caterpillar, Kohler, SDMO, FG Wilson, and many others. Our sales inventory includes options for residential backup, commercial standby, and industrial continuous power applications.",
        },
        {
          question: "How often should my generator be serviced?",
          answer:
            "We recommend servicing standby generators at least once per year or after 200 hours of operation, whichever comes first. For generators used more frequently or in critical applications, more frequent servicing (every 6 months) is advisable. Regular maintenance ensures reliability and extends the lifespan of your equipment.",
        },

          question: "What size generator do I need for my home?",
          answer:
            "The size of generator you need depends on several factors, including your home's square footage, the appliances you want to power during an outage, and your electrical load requirements. Typically, homes require generators ranging from 7kW to 20kW. We offer free assessment services to determine the exact size needed for your specific requirements.",
        },

          question:
            "What's the difference between standby and portable generators?",
          answer:
            "Standby generators are permanently installed, automatically activate during power outages, and can power your entire home or business. They run on natural gas or propane and offer higher power output. Portable generators are smaller, mobile units that must be manually started, typically run on petrol, and can power selected appliances with limited capacity.",
        },
        {
          question: "How long does generator installation take?",
          answer:
            "For residential standby generators, installation typically takes 1-2 days. Commercial installations may take 2-5 days depending on complexity and size. This includes all electrical connections, fuel line installation, and testing. Weather conditions and permit approvals may affect the timeline.",

For rental properties, an EICR is legally required every 5 years. Commercial properties should have more frequent inspections, typically every 3-5 years, with some high-risk environments requiring annual inspections.",

          question: "What is an EICR and why do I need one?",
          answer:
            "An Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) is a comprehensive check of your entire electrical system. It identifies any deterioration, defects, or dangerous conditions in your electrical installations. EICRs are essential for safety, insurance compliance, and are now legally required for rental properties. The inspection examines wiring, sockets, consumer units, and all fixed electrical parts of a property.",

          question: "How much does rewiring a house cost?",
          answer:
            "The cost of rewiring varies significantly based on property size, accessibility, the condition of existing wiring, and your location. For a typical 3-bedroom house, prices generally range from £3,500 to £6,000. We provide detailed quotes after a thorough on-site assessment, with no obligation.",

        {
          question:
            "What electrical certificates do I need when selling my house?",
          answer:
            "When selling a property, while not legally mandatory, having an up-to-date Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) is highly recommended and often requested by buyers or their solicitors. Additionally, any recent electrical work should have appropriate certification under Part P building regulations. These documents provide assurance about the safety of the property's electrical systems.",

          answer:
            "A standard residential solar installation (3-4kW system) typically takes 1-2 days to complete once all permits and approvals are in place. Larger commercial installations may take 3-7 days or more depending on system size and complexity. We'll provide you with a specific timeline during your consultation.",

            "Solar panels require minimal maintenance. We recommend an annual inspection and cleaning to ensure optimal performance. Our maintenance packages include panel cleaning, system inspection, performance testing, and minor repairs. In the UK climate, seasonal cleaning may be beneficial to remove debris and maximize efficiency.",

          question: "Will solar panels work during power cuts?",
          answer:
            "Standard grid-tied solar panel systems will not operate during a power cut for safety reasons. However, we offer solar battery storage solutions that can provide backup power during outages. These systems automatically detect power cuts and can power essential appliances in your home or business until grid power is restored.",

          question: "How much can I save with solar panels?",
          answer:
            "Savings depend on several factors including your system size, energy consumption, and local sunlight conditions. On average, UK homeowners can save between £300-£600 per year on electricity bills with a standard solar installation. With battery storage, these savings can increase. Additionally, you may qualify for the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) payments for excess energy exported to the grid.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need planning permission for solar panels?",
          answer:
            "In most cases, solar panel installations in the UK fall under permitted development rights, meaning no planning permission is required. However, exceptions apply for listed buildings, conservation areas, or if the installation significantly alters the appearance of your property. Our team handles all planning requirements and will advise you on any necessary permissions during the consultation process.",
